               <h3>WEBSITE FOR <br> YOUR BUSINESS </h3>  
                  <p>Why do website prices differ so much? Well, think of it like buying a car. <br>
                     A basic model is cheaper than a tricked-out one with all the bells and whistles, right? 
                      Similarly, <br>
                     a simple website with just a few pages won't cost as much as a fancy e-commerce site with a bunch of features like user accounts and online payments. <br>
                     Plus, where you live and who's doing the work matters too.</p>
